-   Use R\'s `sample()` function to create a random \"genome\" for the purpose of testing functions.

-   Build functions to process and analyze genetic data.

-   Learn about `for` loops and implement them when necessary.

-   Read in a real bacterial genome from a text file.

-   Analyse the genome using the ideas and tools developed in the first part of the notebook.
